[B] stares off into nothing, hands moving by themselves as he dismounts and cleans his gun.

"[B], you alright?"

"Mm? Yeah." Silence. Wood creaks around the encampment, and for a moment both tense, but there is no heavy dragging sound or inhuman moan. "Today woulda been her birthday, y'know. My Emma woulda been six."

"Oh... I'm so sorry. Was it them?

"Nah. Good thing, too. Wouldn't want that end for anyone." 

[D] nods and shudders just to think of it. Not all zombies they've shot down were adults. She can't even fathom having to put Danny down.

"She got sick, man. A whole zombie apocalypse outside and I just sat there with her burning up in my arms ‘cause we didn't have medicine." [B] drops a piece of his gun. Watching it fall is all it takes for him to break. "How is it fair? My little girl. It's not... That's not how it was supposed to be..."

A new building means a lot of things: look around carefully for any zombies, watch out for traps, gather as many supplies as you can find. But as [B] stands guard and [A] and [C] sweep the room clean of any resources, only [D] stands there in the middle of the room. She has found a small toy knight, and for a moment, she is elsewhere, and this room means something more than this dreadful routine.

She sees a small bed in the corner, half covered by a mountain of plushies. She sees a toy box on the floor, and she hears a man and a boy laughing in the distance, playing ball.

"[D]? If you're not doing anything, can you give me a hand?"

[D] snaps out of it. The room is ugly, full of dust and dirt and broken furniture. She thinks she can still make out a crib, or what's left of it. "Sorry. Sure, let me help."

But her mind is still elsewhere. It's with Danny, being watched over by her sister in a shelter, because his father didn't make it. She helps out with the work, carrying boxes of canned food, but she can't stop thinking about every close call they've had.

"Hey, [C]... What happens if we don't come back?" She still feels the weight of the toy in her pocket. It's hard to get birthday gifts anymore. But is she even going to be there for Danny's next one? "All's well risking our lives because someone's gotta do it. But what about those we leave behind? What about those who keep waiting for us to come back... What if we never do?"

[C] can't possibly answer.

[D] is drowning in pain. She can't think, she can only feel the taste of blood on her tongue and try to fight off the darkness.

[A] can't help but think it is a small mercy that she can't hear their panic. "Come on, [C]! Hurry it up with those shots!!"

"I'm looking! I--shit, [A], we're out!"

[A] pales. "What do you mean we're out? She needs it <i>now</i>, [C]! I can use a ripped shirt if we're out of bandages but if she doesn't get her shot she's gonna <i>turn</i>!"

"I <i>know</i>! The airdrops were supposed to come yesterday!"

They both go quiet. There is nothing else to be said: the airdrops that were supposed to come yesterday didn't... or the day before, or the one before that.

"Maybe... Maybe it's just late today." [C]'s voice is trembling, unable to believe the words the moment they're out in the air, but they both know [C] has to say it. Because the other option is just too terrible to consider. What if help isn't coming?

What if they were abandoned?
